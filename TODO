Bugs to fix:

- find a good way for graphics.mpost to handle the fact that several figures
  can be produced by the same source (without using a global variable)

- currently the interface requires LaTeX errors to be reported, while BibTeX
  errors are reported after compilation; harmonize this, i.e. find a stable
  way for modules to report their errors

- let modules that need external programs look for them and fail to load if
  these program are not found

Improvements:

- specify clearly what kind of messages each verbosity level is for

- study the status of the Message class and the way to change the output
  method (the current vt100 trick is not completely satisfactory)

- extend rubber-info for other kinds of information (and find a better name
  for it, maybe)

- check how the program behaves with various TeX implementations

- Introduce a graphics-like system for generating LaTeX sources (this is
  needed to support eps/eps_t figures from XFig)

- provide a way to specify an index style file for makeidx

Long-term ideas:

- use the clean class structuration (possibly cleaning it a bit more) to
  provide other front-ends, e.g. a clever X11 interface

- internationalize the program (this is on the way in CVS in the branch
  'gettextized')

- introduce a configuration file, some kind of .rubberrc

Longer-term ideas:

- design a way to integrate Rubber's action with text editors

- even better: develop a robust, flexible and extensible text editor using
  Python as its scripting language, then make Rubber a plug-in for it

- take over the world
