Bugs to fix:

- find a good way for graphics.mpost to handle the fact that several figures
  can be produced by the same source (without using a global variable)

Improvements:

- study the status of the Message class and the way to change the output
  method (the current vt100 trick is not completely satisfactory)

- extend rubber-info for other kinds of information (and find a better name
  for it, maybe)

- check how the program behaves with various TeX implementations

- add directives to specify which conversion rules should be used

- add new directives, make the directive system into a small scripting
  language, write more modules with this language

Long-term ideas:

- use the clean class structuration (possibly cleaning it a bit more) to
  provide other front-ends, e.g. a clever X11 interface

- internationalize the program (this is on the way in CVS in the branch
  'gettextized')

- introduce a configuration file, some kind of .rubberrc

- find a way to cache the parsing and results between successive compilations
  of a given document
