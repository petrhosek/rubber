Description: an automated system for building LaTeX documents
 This is a building system for LaTeX documents. It is based on a routine that
 runs (hopefully) just as many compilations as necessary. The module system
 provides a great flexibility that virtually allows support for any package
 with no user intervention, as well as pre- and post-processing of the
 document. The standard modules currently provide support for bibtex, dvips,
 pdftex, makeindex, cweb and graphics/graphicx (currently with automatic
 epstopdf conversion and Metapost compilation).
