This is Rubber.

Rubber is a building system for LaTeX documents. It is based on a routine that
runs (hopefully) just as many compilations as necessary. The module system
provides a great flexibility that virtually allows support for any package
with no user intervention, as well as pre- and post-processing of the
document. The associated tool "rubber-info" extracts information, such as
dependency relations or post-compilation diagnostics, in a useful way.


* Installation

Compiling and running Rubber requires Python version 2.1, and nothing more.
For compilation, you will need the Python Distutils, which are usually
included in developpement packages (in Debian, this is the python-dev package).
However, it won't be of much use without a working LaTeX environment...

To compile and install Rubber, just follow the usual procedure:

	./configure
	make
	make install

The options for configuration can be shown using ./configure --help.


* Usage

As civility requires, saying `rubber --help' and `rubber-info --help' provides
a short description of the command line's syntax. The included manual page
(available in English and French) contains more precise usage information.

Thanks to Vincent Beffara, Arnaud Carayol, Samuel Hym, Emmanuel Jeandel and
Guillaume Theyssier for testing, comments and suggestions. And re-thanks to
Vincent Beffara and Emmanuel Jeandel for patches.

Any kind of feedback is appreciated, in order to make this program as useful,
robust and powerful as possible...
