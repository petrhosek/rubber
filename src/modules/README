Conventions for module interfacing:

Each module must contain a class simply named `Module' whose __init__ method
takes the building environment as its first argument and a dictionary as its
second argument. This dictionary describes the command that caused the module
to be loaded, its keys are the following:

  name = the macro's name (i.e. "usepackage" or "RequirePackage", or undefined
    if the module is loaded from the command line)
  arg = the module's name (i.e. the argument of the macro)
  opt = the module's options or None (either \usepackage's optional argument
    or the module options on the command line)

The __init__ function is supposed to register the module's functions using the
following methods of the environment:

  add_hook(name, fun)
    The function `fun' will be called when the macro of the given name is
    found. This function recieves as argument a dictionary that describes the
    macro call with the following keys:
      name = the name of the macro
      opt = the optional argument or None
      arg = the first argument (if it doesn't contains any brace) or None
      line = the rest of the line where the macro occurs

The following member data of the environment can also be modified:

  ext_building
    The list of functions called before the first compilation.
  compile_process
    The list of functions called after each compilation.
  output_processing
    The list of functions called after the last compilation.

  cleaning_process
    The list of functions called when cleaning compilation results.
  removed_files
    A list of additional files to be removed on cleaning.

  src_path = the pathname to the main source
  src_base = the base name of the main source
  src_pbase = the path and base name of the main source
  src_ext = the extension of the main source (e.g. ".tex")
  out_ext = the extension of the compiler's output file (e.g. ".dvi")

  depends = a dictionary that associates the names of the files needed for
    compilation with dependency nodes (from class Depend in rubber.util)

The functions added to compile_process may additionally turn the variable
must_compile to true to force a compilation in the next step.

During execution, all messages must be output using the method

  msg(verbosity_level, text)

of the environment passed to the __init__ method (technically, this is not a
method but a callable object).
